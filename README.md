This version of the LolAuto for users using 1920x1080 monitors, more resolution options coming soon.
If you use 1920x1080, Lol client should be 1280x720.

If you have more than one screen, open the Lol client in the one selected as the main one.

If you have a monitor other than 1920x1080 and don't want to wait for the new version to come out, you can change the images in the images folder, but the upper left corner of your accept button image must be within the clickable point.

Coming soon..
